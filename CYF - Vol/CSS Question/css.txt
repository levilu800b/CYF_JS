<!-- Task 4
You are asked to write a simple website template based on a CSS grid layout.
Requirements
1. Make container the main grid component.
2. Define grid-template-areas to match the following specification:
1. Style the navbar so that it uses the full width of the page and 50px
height.
2. Style the hero so that it uses full width and 80px height.
3. Style the sidebar so that it uses 1/5 of the width and has
automatic height of not less than 190px.
4. Style the content so that it uses the remaining 4/5 of the width and
has the same height as sidebar.
5. Style the footer so that it uses 3/5 of the width and 75px height
and is centered.
Assumptions
The elements you are asked to style on the web page are structured as
follows:
<div class="container">
‹div class="navbar"›</div>
‹div class="hero"></div>
‹div class="sidebar"›</div>
<div class="content"›</div>
<div class="footer"›</div>
</div> -->

Hints
• Colors in the initial code are there just to help you recognize the
sections in the preview; you can modify them as you wish, as they are
not assessed.
